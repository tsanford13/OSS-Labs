## Tommy Sanford - OSS Lab #4

Some good reading materials are [OSI's License page](http://opensource.org/licenses) and the [class lecture notes] (https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-49XX-OpenSource/blob/master/Modules/Licensing/Licensing-S2017-RPI-PatrickMasson.pdf)

### All of the steps below should be recorded in a github file `Lab4.md` in your Labs directory
 

1. Give a Creative Commons license to your lab report (Lab4.md)
![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png) This work is licensed under a http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

1. Read the [four criteria for Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
	* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
	* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
	* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
	* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
2.  Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
    - It's important to have an open source license to cover legal bases. It also provides guidelines for what you can and can't do with your project. Companies can also leverage your software in a way you don't approve of if you don't choose the correct license. 
3.  Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
   
	- When a project doesn't have a license, there are no clear guidelines or legal boundaries. For example, someone could steal your code and claim it as their own and you couldn't do anything about it because you weren't operating under a license.

4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of [Why the Web beat Gopher](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain).
    - I agree with Richard Gabriel's claim that the earlier in the development process that the code is released, the more opportunities for worthwhile contributions arise. However, as described in the rest of the article, there can be issues with mass amounts of forks created which can cause confusion, which is what the Gopher project fell victim to.
5.  Android uses the [Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), [Linux uses the  GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ) license,
Microsoft [.NET Core uses MIT license]( https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr ), SailfishOS is [not open source]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS ).
    - Google publishes the Android source code via the Apache 2.0 license. The Apache license allows for modification and distribution, however it does not grant rights to the "Android" trademark so device makers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google individually via contracts. This is a smart business model; the source code is out there for device makers and carriers to use, however they have to pay Google in order to use the "Android" trademark. The terms of the Apache license are what allow this to occur which is probably why they chose the Apache license in this instance.

10.  Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io/projects) or [past RCOS Projects](https://rcos.io/projects/past) and create a table for which project has which license. for example:

Website | License Present | License
---------|:----------|:-------
https://github.com/Wright-Language-Developers/Wright-Lang | Yes | MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
https://github.com/tdurkin18/Anagrams | Yes | GNU General Public License v3.0 https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
https://github.com/kool814/ClickbaitChromeExtension | Yes | MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
https://github.com/rmarathay/hedgehogs | Yes | MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
https://github.com/andywu9/githuboutlookaddin | Yes | MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

When you have completed the lab, submit a text file with a link to your `Lab4.md` file via Submitty.
